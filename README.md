# SpriteBuilder

SpriteBuilder is the first game development suite for rapidly building native iOS and Android games with Objective-C and Xcode. SpriteBuilder is free and open source (MIT licensed).
Core Features:

* Designer-friendly UI
* Animation editor for scenes, characters and boned animations
* Tileless editor
* User interface designer
* Asset management & sprite sheet generation
* Tools for localization


## Getting started with the source

Change directory into the top (this) directory of SpriteBuilder and run:

    git clone https://github.com/apportable/SpriteBuilder
    cd SpriteBuilder
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    cd scripts
    ./build_distribution.py --version 1.4.x
	compile in Xcode 
	
You need to use the BuildDistribution.sh script the first time you build SpriteBuilder, after that you can build it from within Xcode.
